# QNamer
QNamer (short for QuickNamer), is an extremely simple program for uniquely mass renaming files in a directory.

It renames each file in the current program's directory to follow the UUID Version 4 format, and preserves all file extensions.

## FAQ
### How do I run the program?
Simply run the compiled executable in the directory you want **all** files renamed. (All except the executable)
### The program doesn't work correctly after I renamed the executable / The program renames itself
The program file name must end in `QNamer.exe`, meaning that `! QNamer.exe` will work, but `QuickRenamerProgram.exe` will not, and may result unknown behavior.
### I broke the program, what should I do?
Not sure how you did it, but you can always create an issue and/or a pull request to help this (very quickly made) program/repository.
### Why did you make this?
I needed a program to rename my folder of videos to something all unique, simple as that.
